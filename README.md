### Hi there, I'm Alice ðŸ‘‹

I am an undergraduate student at UBC majoring in Computer Science :seedling:

You can reach me via [email](mailto:aliceykim0828@gmail.com?Subject=Hi%20there!) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/yehee). To check out a list of projects that I've been working on: [yehee.github.io](https://yehee.github.io)

I major in CS because I love to be challenged, and the projects I work on could potentially impact millions of people around the globe. I have previously interned at [Google](https://www.google.ca/) and [SAP](https://www.sap.com/canada/index.html). Feel free to reach out if you'd like to learn more about my experience or any of the projects I've worked on. I'd love to chat âœ¨
